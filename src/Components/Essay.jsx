            {/* Samwise Gamgee - Faith and Hope */}
            <section className="samwise-gamgee">
                <h2 className="essay-section-title">With Eyes of Faith and Hope</h2>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    In J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Samwise Gamgee best embodies faith and hope
                    through his obstinate faith in Frodo and hope for a better future for Middle-earth.
                </p>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    First, Sam serves as a pillar of faith for Frodo, supporting his friend in the moments he needs it
                    the most. In <i>The Return of the King</i>, when Frodo collapses on the sinister slopes of Mount
                    Doom, Sam says, <q className="quote">“I can’t carry it for you, but I can carry you”</q> (Tolkien
                    922). This moment illustrates Sam’s faith in their shared quest, at a time where all seemed lost,
                    lending his strength to Frodo, as Frodo’s own strength falters.
                </p>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    Next, Sam shows a remarkable ability to find hope in the desolate darkness of Mordor. While walking
                    through the barren plains, he remarks, <q className="quote">“Above all shadows rides the Sun, and
                    Stars forever dwell: I will not say the Day is done, nor bid the Stars farewell.”</q> This final
                    declaration highlights Sam's unwavering belief that, even in darkness, hope—symbolized by the Sun
                    and Stars—endures. His refusal to say “the Day is done” reflects his resilience and faith that there
                    is always time to fight for Middle-earth.
                </p>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    Finally, Sam’s faith in Frodo remains unshaken when faced with insurmountable odds. When the hobbits
                    reach Rivendell, and the council outlines the perilous journey ahead of Frodo, Sam’s defiant voice
                    rings out, <q className="quote">“But you won’t send him off alone surely, Master?”</q> (Tolkien
                    353). Sam’s faith in Frodo, even when faced with a harsh and dangerous journey ahead, and his desire
                    to accompany him despite the danger shows the faith he has in his friend. Sam’s faith and hope is
                    not passive; it drives him to action, ensuring that Frodo is never alone, and a brighter future for
                    Middle-earth.

            {/* Gandalf - Kindness and Love */}
            <section className="gandalf">
                <h2 className="essay-section-title">With Eyes of Kindness and Love</h2>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    Gandalf is the most kind and caring character in J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
                </p>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    First, Gandalf is the very definition of a protector, not hesitating to put others before himself.
                    When passing through the mines of Moria, Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice himself for the sake
                    of the fellowship, shouting, <q className="quote">“Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I must hold
                    the narrow way. Fly!”</q> Gandalf’s willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice serves as a testament
                    to his caring nature, emphasizing how his first instinct is to think about others.
                </p>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    Next, Gandalf’s interactions with Frodo offer yet another testament to his kind and caring nature.
                    In <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, when Frodo laments, <q className="quote">“I wish it need not
                    have happened in my time,”</q> Gandalf replies, <q className="quote">“So do I, and so do all who
                    live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with
                    the time that is given us.”</q> Gandalf’s reply acknowledges the importance of Frodo’s concern,
                    while encouraging him to make the best of his situation, gently directing him towards action and
                    hope, demonstrating Gandalf’s loving nature.
                </p>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    Gandalf’s empathetic perspective toward Gollum reveals his deep understanding of human nature and
                    his capacity for compassion, even toward those who have done wrong. Finally, Gandalf further
                    demonstrates his kind nature through his empathetic treatment of Gollum. While talking to Frodo in
                    the Shire, Gandalf warns Frodo against judging Gollum harshly, saying, <q className="quote">“Many
                    that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too
                    eager to deal out death in judgement.”</q> Gandalf’s empathetic perspective toward Gollum reveals
                    his deep understanding of human nature and his capacity for compassion, even toward those who have
                    done wrong.
                </p>
                <p className="essay-text">
                    Through his selflessness, wisdom, and empathy, Gandalf consistently demonstrates his kind and caring
                    nature, making him a moral anchor and a guiding force in the epic journey of <i>The Lord of the
                    Rings</i>.

            {/* Aragorn, Frodo, Gandalf - Justice and Peace */}

            <section className="justice-and-peace">
                <h2 className="essay-section-title">With Eyes of Justice and Peace</h2>

                <p className="essay-text">
                    Justice and peace are central themes in J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and the
                    characters of Aragorn, Frodo, and Gandalf exemplify these values through their actions and decisions
                    in the face of great adversity.
                </p>

                <p className="essay-text">
                    First, Aragorn embodies justice through his willingness to assume the burden of leadership and
                    restore fairness to Gondor. As the rightful heir to the throne, Aragorn understands the importance
                    of justice in restoring peace to the kingdom. When he arrives at the Battle of Helm’s Deep, he leads
                    not only with strength but with a sense of moral responsibility. He says, <q className="quote">“I am
                    Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself”</q> (Tolkien 1134), highlighting that his role is not about
                    power, but about using his position to right the wrongs that have plagued the realm. This statement
                    emphasizes Aragorn’s sense of justice, where leadership is about serving others and ensuring peace
                    for all, not just the powerful.
                </p>

                <p className="essay-text">
                    Next, Frodo represents the quiet pursuit of justice and peace through his selflessness and
                    restraint. As the Ring-bearer, Frodo carries the burden of the One Ring, yet he consistently chooses
                    to act in ways that reflect his commitment to justice, even at great personal cost. For example,
                    Frodo’s decision to spare Gollum’s life demonstrates his belief in mercy and forgiveness. When he
                    says, <q className="quote">“I will not give my name to the shadow of death”</q> (Tolkien 617), Frodo
                    reflects his deep conviction that justice is not about destruction, but about compassion and
                    offering second chances. His actions show that true justice involves understanding, not judgment,
                    and a desire for peace even in the face of betrayal.
                </p>

                <p className="essay-text">
                    Finally, Gandalf’s wisdom and sense of justice make him a powerful force for peace throughout
                    Middle-earth. He is always striving for a balance between taking action and allowing others to
                    choose their path. His belief in peace over violence is evident when he says, <q className="quote">“Many
                    that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too
                    eager to deal out death in judgement”</q> (Tolkien 301). Gandalf’s statement reveals his deep
                    understanding of the complexities of human nature and his belief that peace can only be achieved by
                    exercising justice with empathy, not vengeance. This makes Gandalf a moral compass, guiding others
                    toward a peaceful resolution of conflict.
                </p>

                <p className="essay-text">
                    In conclusion, the characters of Aragorn, Frodo, and Gandalf demonstrate that justice and peace are
                    not merely abstract ideals, but principles that drive their actions, from leadership to forgiveness
                    and wisdom. Through their examples, Tolkien shows that true justice leads to a lasting peace,
                    achieved through understanding, selflessness, and empathy.
